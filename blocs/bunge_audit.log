Ensuring that scales are regularly calibrated and certified can help minimize this issue.\n\n4. **Natural Settling/Compaction**: During transit, soybeans may settle or compact, which can affect the volume and perceived weight when measured.\n\n5. **Temperature/Humidity Effects**: Changes in temperature and humidity during transport can also impact the weight of the shipment, as these factors influence moisture content and density.\n\nIn the context of industry standards, a variance of -0.17% is generally considered to be within acceptable limits for bulk agricultural commodities like soybeans. Such minor discrepancies are common and typically fall within the range of expected variations due to the factors mentioned above.\n\nOverall, this variance does not indicate any significant issues with the shipment and aligns with standard industry expectations. Continuous monitoring and adherence to best practices in handling and measurement can further ensure that variances remain within acceptable ranges."}}, "entry_hash": "c89064c2f215c8929302cbb9c6cc8f0fd3e961a7f18c214a6d53ba5fca699088", "signature": "cb0fc8f36681c16b1422413db70a363602cb89b2e45328ac806e868f97afde06", "signed_by": "G&G FOODS Inc"}

Depending on the environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, the soybeans may lose moisture, leading to a reduction in weight. This is a typical occurrence and can account for minor discrepancies in weight.\n\n2. **Handling Losses**: During loading and unloading, some loss is inevitable due to spillage or residues left in containers and transport vehicles.

The soybean industry typically allows for minor weight discrepancies due to the aforementioned factors, with variances up to 0.5% often deemed within normal operational limits. Therefore, this variance is within acceptable industry standards and does not indicate any significant issue with the shipment.\n\nIn conclusion, the observed weight variance is minor and can be reasonably explained by typical factors affecting soybean shipments. Stakeholders can be assured that this variance is within industry"}}, "entry_hash": "aa4a9625528b3f9c70d9841e0a6c862499c8143507b330c0438f14cea75eb897", "signature": "23274d19454b9ed0a3329224f19211e1c49157ec3689470b516b7e44a9ff34f0", "signed_by": "G&G FOODS Inc"}

Regular monitoring and adherence to best practices in handling and transportation will continue to"}}, "entry_hash": "524b8c53726025a78bfc8f6ce434e91650471bcbf02fb615a7835ffaf2b2b4da", "signature": "77868461fa516a2c2580e7f25a20c85b64c0270e4efd46c67382b00c7ab7323d", "signed_by": "G&G FOODS Inc"}

Stakeholders can be assured that this variance is not unusual and does not impact the overall integrity of the shipment."}}, "entry_hash": "11bc20241958cfbb3a7d51fa8b961746415b4d37310516aef98202a3f86863ed", "signature": "1f18830ee84505d440cf54fabc2a6ee8b4db99ac3df126a513b57b73532f831f", "signed_by": "G&G FOODS Inc"}

Continuous monitoring and adherence to best practices in handling and transportation can help minimize these variances, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in future shipments."}}, "entry_hash": "fd87b5eee47410fda4f48f67d83900135f66067b79e30380391a924fcd8964d1", "signature": "131e2572f1c7b292d4e4b7da9f0b49a3f4db0adf77bc1e6bca88b368d4cc8f61", "signed_by": "G&G FOODS Inc"}

Therefore, this variance is considered normal and does not indicate any significant issues with the shipment process.\n\nIn conclusion, the weight variance observed in this soybean shipment is within acceptable limits and can be attributed to common factors affecting bulk commodity transportation. Stakeholders can be assured that such variances are typical and accounted for in industry practices."}}, "entry_hash": "8640cc78b0378ee39448c6cdcda39d3c54e63952dfc6a843e5a84ee1a78bc530", "signature": "c8a737c9b3cbd0ec0f8c90c3b58b2fb15a8f1482a1591298ee08ba651062020b", "signed_by": "G&G FOODS Inc"}

A slight reduction in moisture can lead to a decrease in weight, contributing to the observed variance.\n\n2. **Handling Losses**: During loading, unloading, and handling, minor losses can occur. Spillage or residue left in transport containers can account for a small portion of the weight discrepancy.\n\n3. **Scale Calibration Differences**: Variations in scale calibration between the point of origin and the destination can lead to differences in recorded weights. Even minor discrepancies in scale accuracy can impact the final weight measurement.\n\n4. **Natural Settling/Compaction**: During transport, the natural settling or compaction of soybeans can occur, potentially affecting the volume and perceived weight of the shipment.\n\n5. **Temperature/Humidity Effects**: Changes in temperature and humidity during transit can influence the physical properties of soybeans, potentially affecting their weight.\n\nThe reported variance of -0.17% is relatively minor and typically falls within the acceptable industry standards for agricultural shipments. Industry standards often allow for a variance of up to 0.5% to 1% due to the aforementioned factors. Therefore, this variance is considered normal and acceptable, indicating that the shipment was handled and transported within the expected parameters.\n\nIn conclusion, the weight variance observed in this soybean shipment is within acceptable industry standards and can be attributed to common factors such as moisture changes, handling losses, and scale calibration differences. Stakeholders can be assured that such variances are typical and do not indicate any significant issues with the shipment process."}}, "entry_hash": "41125b77c3413cf16c98d078a260b460c4cab11a395822f651877a1fbc0df29b", "signature": "27656775b44224333840657a0ef3acd0375019525a9a92987166a25de45efc7f", "signed_by": "G&G FOODS Inc"}

Stakeholders can be assured that such variances are normal and accounted for in standard shipping and handling"}}, "entry_hash": "6d051e2e9196d277cc19dffa235bd606f6d374fea936e74d9286d85275f88a6a", "signature": "b4c1854a526fed49422c29d43f324d11bdd748f00d1750eecadf8a5a11136970", "signed_by": "G&G FOODS Inc"}

Industry standards often allow for a variance of up to 0.5% to 1% due to the factors mentioned above. Therefore, this variance is considered normal and does not indicate any significant issues with the shipment.\n\nIn conclusion, the weight variance observed in this soybean shipment is within acceptable limits and can be attributed to common factors affecting agricultural commodities during transport. Regular monitoring and adherence to best practices in handling and measurement can help maintain such variances within industry standards."}}, "entry_hash": "791178e5b7b6fab59c5c95e5bfb6e96f9357c27199b04849637ccfde0c2fecdf", "signature": "70401e33b4519d7ecbcad3eb86cdccb989183d63687d28ef3085c04601021ad7", "signed_by": "G&G FOODS Inc"}

However, this is less likely to significantly impact the actual weight.\n\n5. **Temperature/Humidity Effects**: Changes in temperature and humidity during transport can affect the physical properties of soybeans, including their weight. While these effects are generally minimal, they can contribute to slight variances.\n\nThe observed variance of -0.17% is within the typical range for soybean shipments and is generally considered acceptable in the industry. Variances up to 0.5% are often deemed acceptable due to the inherent challenges in maintaining exact weights during transport and handling. \n\nIn conclusion, the minor variance observed in this shipment is consistent with standard industry expectations and does not indicate any significant issues with the shipment process. Regular monitoring and adherence to best practices in handling and weighing can help maintain these variances within acceptable limits."}}, "entry_hash": "e542606f68a8fa30c0feed37e91bba537c3670769d9b9dc7c67abec485d1e450", "signature": "e56358a4006373dde945ff3acfaf56723f13a6ae1a699134c4be5508b48b3ddf", "signed_by": "G&G FOODS Inc"}
